# hello-world

Hello world! Yeah I know cliché right...oh well!

My name is Edan "René" Ramos, I am a divorced father with two beautiful daughters! They are 17, and 11 years old and are the lights of my life.

I am also a creative at heart, from musician, to photographer, to well trying to be anyway, a web designer/graphic designer. So I guess we will see!
